The prototypeâ€™s key part is the Texas Instruments `TM4C1294XL Launchpad` processing data from the user interface, controlling the watering actuators and handling control and data from moisture measurement circuits. `API Version 0.6` allows a user to configure the duty cycle of the power supply of the connected `pump` and to select the required watering line by switching `solenoid valves`. Furthermore, users can calibrate the `moisture measurement` by configuring the soil dry and wet thresholds. Besides these configuration functionalities, users can enable automated irrigation for each irrigation line separately. All functionalities are accessible via `LCD touchscreen`.\r\n___\r\nAPI - Version 0.6 includes following Hardware Abstraction Layers\r\n\r\n##Valve Control\r\n+ tpic6a595_hal.c\r\n+ tpic6a595_hal.h\r\n\r\n##Pump Control\r\n+ boost_drv8848_hal.c\r\n+ boost_drv8848_hal.h\r\n\r\n## Moisture Measurement Sensor\r\n+ moisture_hal.c\r\n+ moisture_hal.h\r\n\r\n## TFT QVGA Display\r\n###Display\r\n+ Kentec320x240x16_ssd2119_spi.c\r\n+ Kentec320x240x16_ssd2119_spi.h\r\n\r\n###Touchscreen\r\n+ Kentec320x240x16_touch_tm4c1294xl.c\r\n+ Kentec320x240x16_touch_tm4c1294xl.h","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
